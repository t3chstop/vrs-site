# Quickstart

This guide is for people with previous programming experience who wish to get familiar
with the Virtual Robot Simulator interface. It will cover installation and the basics
of both game modes. For more detailed information and technical explanations, see 
[courses](/courses/)

Like the FTC competition, Virtual Robot Simulator supports two different game styles. 
These are Autonomous and TeleOp. In an FTC competition, there is a 30 second autonomous 
period which is followed by a two minute TeleOp period. 

Also like FTC, Virtual Robot Simulator supports Blocks and Java. Blocks are similar to 
scratch programming and use a graphical user interface and connectable blocks to make
easily understandable instructions. Even those with previous programming experience are
encouraged to start with blocks. See [getting started with blocks](courses/getting-started.html) for a comprehensive guide on VRS blocks programming.

## Download

Virtual Robot Simulator is only supported on Windows, but is lightweight enough to run 
on most Windows systems. Being open source, you can build VRS from the source code.The code is hosted in a few different repositories, but you can find a comprehensive build guide [here]( ). You can also download the windows installer from this website's [home page](/), and run it after it finishes downloading.

If you download from the installer, you need to make no modifications to your system.


## Autonomous

Autonomous programming does not take user input. All the instructions are hard coded, but  the robot can use sensor input for judgement. In VRS, we use blocks for autonomous programming.
